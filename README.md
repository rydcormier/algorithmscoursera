My coursework for the *Algorithms and Data Structures* specialization \
offered by UC San Diego and the National Research University Higher School \
of Economics. The courses are ordered:
1. Algorithmic Toolbox
2. Data Structures
3. Algorithms on Graphs
4. Algorithms on Strings
5. Advanced Algorithms and Complexity
6. Keystone Project: Genome Assembly Programming Challenge

### Most Recent Work

[phi_X174_error_free_overlap.cpp](https://github.com/rydcormier/algorithmscoursera/blob/master/Genome%20Assembly%20Programming%20Challenge/Programming%20Assignment%201/phiX174_error_free_overlap.cpp)

Assembles the phi X174 phage genome from 1618 simulated error free reads.

[budget_allocation.cpp](https://github.com/rydcormier/algorithmscoursera/blob/master/Advanced%20Algorithms%20and%20Complexity/Programming%20Assignment%203/budget_allocation.cpp)

An ILP to SAT reduction. The corresponding formula in CNF form is printed
for use in a SAT solver.

[puzzle.cpp](https://github.com/rydcormier/algorithmscoursera/blob/master/Genome%20Assembly%20Programming%20Challenge/Programming%20Assignment%202/puzzle.cpp)

Given 25 puzzle pieces, returns a 5 x 5 grid of the "solved" puzzle.

[eulerian_cycle.cpp](https://github.com/rydcormier/algorithmscoursera/blob/master/Genome%20Assembly%20Programming%20Challenge/Programming%20Assignment%202/eulerian_cycle.cpp)

Determines if the given directed graph is Eulerian and if so a Eulerian \
path is printed to standard output.
