My coursework for the *Algorithms and Data Structures* specialization \
through UC San Diego and the National Research University Higher School \
of Economics. The course order is:
1. Algorithmic Toolbox
2. Data Structures
3. Algorithms on Graphs
4. Algorithms on Strings
5. Advanced Algorithms and Complexity
6. Keystone Project: Genome Assembly Programming Challenge

[phi_X174_error_free_overlap.cpp](https://github.com/rydcormier/algorithmscoursera/blob/master/Genome%20Assembly%20Programming%20Challenge/Programming%20Assignment%201/phiX174_error_free_overlap.cpp)

This is from the Genome Assembly Programming Challenge. \
Given the input of 1000 simulated error-free reads randomly drawn from \
5,386-nucleotide long phi X174 genome, this program performs the task of
Genome Assembly and returns the original circular genome.
