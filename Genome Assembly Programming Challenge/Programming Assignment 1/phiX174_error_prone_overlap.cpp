//
//  This programs reads 1618 reads of length 100 from standard input and
//  then assembles and returns the circular genome from which the reads
//  came. This program uses an overlap graph that accounts for possible
//  errors in the reads when calculating edge weights. A Hamiltonian
//  path is constructed maximizing overlap.
