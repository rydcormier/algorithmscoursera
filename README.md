### Recent Work
[tip_detection.cpp](https://github.com/rydcormier/algorithmscoursera/blob/master/Genome%20Assembly%20Programming%20Challenge/Programming%20Assignment%203/tip_removal.cpp)

This program simulates the task of tip removal on a De Bruign graph constructed \
from a set of error-prone reads.

[bubble_detection.cpp](https://github.com/rydcormier/algorithmscoursera/blob/master/Genome%20Assembly%20Programming%20Challenge/Programming%20Assignment%203/bubble_detection.cpp)

This program counts the number of bubbles-pairs of short, non-overlapping, \
disjoint paths between two vertices-on a De Bruijn graph constructed from the \
K-mers generated from a set of error-prone reads.

[phiX174_kmer.cpp](https://github.com/rydcormier/algorithmscoursera/blob/master/Genome%20Assembly%20Programming%20Challenge/Programming%20Assignment%202/phiX174_kmer.cpp)

This program assembles the phi X174 phage genome from its 10-mer composition. 

[phi_X174_error_free_overlap.cpp](https://github.com/rydcormier/algorithmscoursera/blob/master/Genome%20Assembly%20Programming%20Challenge/Programming%20Assignment%201/phiX174_error_free_overlap.cpp)

Assembles the phi X174 phage genome from 1618 simulated error free reads by \
finding a Hamiltonian path on an overlap graph.

[optimal_k_mer_size.cpp](https://github.com/rydcormier/algorithmscoursera/blob/master/Genome%20Assembly%20Programming%20Challenge/Programming%20Assignment%203/optimal_k_mer_size.cpp)

Given a set of reads, this program determines the maximum k such that a \
a de Bruign graph created from all k-length fragments of the reads has \
a single possible Eulerian cycle.

[circulation.cpp](https://github.com/rydcormier/algorithmscoursera/blob/master/Genome%20Assembly%20Programming%20Challenge/Programming%20Assignment%203/circulation.cpp)

Determines if a circulataion on the given flow network is feasible.
